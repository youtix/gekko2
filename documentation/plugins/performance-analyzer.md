# Performance Analyzer Plugin

The **PerformanceAnalyzer** plugin is responsible for tracking and reporting the performance of a trading strategy over time. It listens to portfolio value changes and executed trades, calculates advanced performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, alpha, etc.), and emits performance reports after every trade and at the end of the run.

This plugin is useful for both backtests and live runs to evaluate how profitable and stable a strategy is.

```
ðŸ’¡ Note:
- This plugin is read-only. It only analyzes and reports.
- Requires data from the `Trader` plugin to function correctly.
- Designed to work in both realtime and backtest modes.
```

## Configuration

In your configuration file, under the `plugins` section, configure the PerformanceAnalyzer plugin like this:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: PerformanceAnalyzer # Must be set to PerformanceAnalyzer
    riskFreeReturn: 5         # Optional: annualized % return of a risk-free asset (e.g., government bonds)
```

## Events Emitted

The **PerformanceAnalyzer** plugin emits a number of events that are used to track performance and roundtrips.
