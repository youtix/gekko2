# Volume Indicators

Volume indicators analyze the amount of trading activity over time. They are commonly used to confirm trends, identify potential reversals, and detect the strength behind price movements. When combined with price data, volume analysis can provide deeper insights into market sentiment and the validity of price signals.

Examples of widely used volume indicators include On-Balance Volume (OBV), Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL), Money Flow Index (MFI), and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).
