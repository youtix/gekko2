# Moving Averages

Moving averages are one of the most widely used tools in technical analysis. They smooth out price data over a defined period to help identify the direction of a trend and filter out market noise. Gekko 2 includes several types of moving averages, each with its own behavior and use case.

## **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**

SMA calculates the arithmetic mean of prices over a given period. It gives equal weight to each data point. It's useful for identifying trends and support/resistance levels but can be slow to react to sudden price changes.

## **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**

EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new data than the SMA. It reacts faster to recent price changes and is popular for short-term trend tracking.

## **DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average)**

DEMA is designed to reduce the lag of traditional EMAs. It combines an EMA and another EMA applied to the first EMA, providing a smoother and more responsive trend-following line.

## **TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)**

TEMA further reduces lag compared to EMA and DEMA by combining a single EMA, a double EMA, and a triple EMA into one formula. This results in a moving average that is even more responsive to price changes while maintaining smoothness, making it useful for traders who want to minimize lag in their signals.

## **WMA (Weighted Moving Average)**

WMA assigns more weight to recent prices by multiplying each price by a weight based on its age. This makes it more sensitive than SMA or EMA to recent price movements.

## **SMMA (Smoothed Moving Average)**

SMMA is similar to EMA but applies a longer smoothing factor, resulting in a slower and smoother curve. It’s useful for filtering out extreme short-term volatility.

## **WilderSmoothing**

This smoothing method is based on the technique introduced by J. Welles Wilder and is often used in indicators like ATR and RSI. It is a form of exponential smoothing that reduces lag while maintaining stability.

## Super Guppy

Super Guppy combines 22 EMAs with increasing periods to form two ribbons (fast and slow). It tracks the alignment and spread of these EMAs to assess trend direction and strength. It’s useful for identifying sustained trends and spotting early reversals.
