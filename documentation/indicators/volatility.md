# Volatility Indicators

Volatility indicators measure the rate and magnitude of price fluctuations in the market. They help traders assess the level of risk, identify breakout opportunities, and determine when markets may shift from trending to ranging conditions (or vice versa).

These indicators are especially useful for adjusting position sizing, setting stop-loss levels, or avoiding trades during high-risk periods.

Common volatility indicators include Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR), Keltner Channels, and Chandelier Exit.

## **TrueRange**

True Range is the raw measure of volatility, calculated as the greatest of:
- Current high minus current low
- Absolute value of current high minus previous close
- Absolute value of current low minus previous close

ATR is simply a smoothed version of True Range.

## **ATR (Average True Range)**

ATR measures market volatility by averaging the true range over a specified number of periods. While it doesnâ€™t indicate trend direction, it helps assess how volatile a market is.
