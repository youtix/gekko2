# Oscillators

Oscillators are a type of technical indicator that fluctuate within a fixed range, typically between two levels, and are used to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. They are especially helpful when the market is moving sideways or lacking a clear trend.

Oscillators can help traders anticipate potential reversals or confirm the strength of an ongoing move. Common examples include RSI (Relative Strength Index), Stochastic Oscillator, and CCI (Commodity Channel Index).
