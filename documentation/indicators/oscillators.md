# Oscillators

Oscillators are a type of technical indicator that fluctuate within a fixed range, typically between two levels, and are used to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. They are especially helpful when the market is moving sideways or lacking a clear trend.

Oscillators can help traders anticipate potential reversals or confirm the strength of an ongoing move. Common examples include RSI (Relative Strength Index), Stochastic Oscillator, and CCI (Commodity Channel Index).

## **AO (Awesome Oscillator)**

The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a momentum indicator that measures market momentum by comparing the 34-period and 5-period simple moving averages, calculated using the midpoints of each candlestick. AO fluctuates above and below a zero line, helping to identify trend direction and potential reversals. Positive values indicate bullish momentum, while negative values suggest bearish momentum.

## **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator that measures the deviation of the price from its average over a specified period. CCI values above +100 indicate overbought conditions, while values below -100 indicate oversold conditions. It is useful for identifying cyclical trends and potential reversal points.

## **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. RSI values above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 suggest oversold conditions. RSI is widely used to identify potential reversal points and confirm trend strength.
