# Momentum Indicators

Momentum indicators help assess the strength and speed of price movements. They are useful for identifying overbought or oversold conditions, spotting trend reversals, and confirming the momentum behind price trends.


## **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

MACD is a momentum indicator that subtracts a long-term EMA from a short-term EMA. It is commonly used to detect trend changes, with crossovers of the MACD line and signal line being key trading signals.

## **ROC (Rate of Change)**

ROC measures the percentage change between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. It fluctuates above and below a zero line. Positive values indicate upward momentum, while negative values suggest downward momentum. It's a simple and effective tool for spotting acceleration or deceleration in price trends.

## **PSAR (Parabolic Stop and Reverse)**

The Parabolic SAR (PSAR) is a momentum indicator used to determine potential reversals in market price direction. It appears as a series of dots placed above or below the price chart. When the dots are below the price, it signals an uptrend; when they are above, it signals a downtrend. PSAR is commonly used to set trailing stop-loss levels and to identify entry and exit points in trending markets.

## **Stochastic Oscillator**

The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a particular closing price to a range of its prices over a certain period. It consists of two lines: %K (the main line) and %D (a moving average of %K). Values above 80 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 20 suggest oversold conditions. The Stochastic Oscillator is useful for identifying potential reversal points and confirming trend strength.

## **Stochastic RSI**

Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) applies the Stochastic Oscillator formula to RSI values instead of price data. It measures the level of RSI relative to its range over a set period, providing a more sensitive momentum indicator. Values above 0.8 indicate overbought conditions, while values below 0.2 indicate oversold conditions. StochRSI is useful for identifying short-term price extremes and potential reversal points.

## **TRIX (Triple Exponential Average)**

TRIX is a momentum oscillator that displays the percent rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average. It filters out insignificant price movements and is designed to identify the direction of the trend and possible turning points. Positive TRIX values suggest upward momentum, while negative values indicate downward momentum.

## **Williams %R**

Williams %R is a momentum indicator that measures overbought and oversold levels by comparing the current closing price to the high-low range over a specified period. The indicator ranges from 0 to -100. Readings above -20 indicate overbought conditions, while readings below -80 indicate oversold conditions. Williams %R helps identify potential reversal points and market extremes.
