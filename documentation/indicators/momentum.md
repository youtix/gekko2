# Momentum Indicators

Momentum indicators help assess the strength and speed of price movements. They are useful for identifying overbought or oversold conditions, spotting trend reversals, and confirming the momentum behind price trends.


## **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

MACD is a momentum indicator that subtracts a long-term EMA from a short-term EMA. It is commonly used to detect trend changes, with crossovers of the MACD line and signal line being key trading signals.

## **ROC (Rate of Change)**

ROC measures the percentage change between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. It fluctuates above and below a zero line. Positive values indicate upward momentum, while negative values suggest downward momentum. It's a simple and effective tool for spotting acceleration or deceleration in price trends.

## **PSAR (Parabolic Stop and Reverse)**

The Parabolic SAR (PSAR) is a momentum indicator used to determine potential reversals in market price direction. It appears as a series of dots placed above or below the price chart. When the dots are below the price, it signals an uptrend; when they are above, it signals a downtrend. PSAR is commonly used to set trailing stop-loss levels and to identify entry and exit points in trending markets.
