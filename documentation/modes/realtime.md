# Realtime Mode

The **Realtime** mode allows you to run a trading strategy live on market data as it streams from the exchange.  
It is designed for actual operation, where decisions must be made in real time — whether simulated or real.

This mode is flexible and supports **three different execution types** depending on your goals:

## 1. Paper Trader (Simulated Local Trading)

The **Paper Trader** plugin simulates trading using fake money.  
It listens to the advice generated by your strategy and calculates the result as if you were actually trading.

✅ Good for:
- Safely testing your strategy in real market conditions.
- Evaluating strategy behavior over time.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `PaperTrader` – to simulate orders.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to evaluate strategy performance.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, etc.

❗ Do **not** enable `Trader` when using `PaperTrader`.

## 2. Sandbox Trader (Simulated Trading via Broker API)

The **Sandbox** mode behaves like live trading, but uses the sandbox / testnet environment provided by supported exchanges.  
It sends orders to the broker API using fake money accounts, which mimic real-world behavior more closely.

✅ Good for:
- Testing broker integration and order execution flows.
- More realistic simulation of latency, fees, partial fills, etc.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `Trader` – configure with sandbox/testnet API credentials.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to monitor profitability.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, `Telegram`, etc.

❗ Not all exchanges support sandbox/testnet environments.

## 3. Live Trader (Real Money Trading)

The **Live Trader** mode enables real money trading.  
It connects directly to your broker/exchange account, places actual orders based on your strategy's advice, and manages your real portfolio.

✅ Good for:
- Live deployment of a thoroughly tested strategy.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `Trader` – with real API credentials.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to monitor performance.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, `Telegram`, etc.

❗ High risk: Make sure your strategy has been tested thoroughly.  
Gekko only executes what your strategy tells it to do.

## General Notes

- **Only one trading plugin can be active at a time** (`PaperTrader` **or** `Trader`).
- Realtime mode supports **plugin composition**, so you can add loggers, notifications, performance analysis, etc.
- It's ideal to run Gekko in a long-lived environment like a VPS or Docker container.

## Recommended Before Going Live

- Backtest thoroughly using historical data.
- Run in Paper Trader or Sandbox mode for an extended period.
- Monitor logs and Telegram messages for unexpected behavior.
- Ensure you understand the exchange’s fees, limits, and slippage risks.
