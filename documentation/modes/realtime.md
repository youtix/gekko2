# Realtime Mode

The **Realtime** mode allows you to run a trading strategy live on market data as it streams from the exchange.  
It is designed for actual operation, where decisions must be made in real time — whether simulated or real.

This mode is flexible and supports **three different execution types** depending on your goals:

## 1. Dummy Exchange (Simulated Local Trading)

The **Trader** plugin can run against the built-in dummy exchange to simulate trading with fake money.
It listens to advice generated by your strategy and settles orders locally without ever talking to a real exchange.

✅ Good for:
- Safely testing your strategy in real market conditions.
- Evaluating strategy behavior over time.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `Trader` – configured with the `dummy-cex` exchange.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to evaluate strategy performance.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, etc.

## 2. Sandbox Exchange (Simulated Trading via Exchange API)

Configure the Trader plugin with sandbox / testnet credentials for your exchange.
Orders are placed against the exchange-provided simulation environment, which mimics real-world behavior more closely.

✅ Good for:
- Testing exchange integration and order execution flows.
- More realistic simulation of latency, fees, partial fills, etc.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `Trader` – configure with sandbox/testnet API credentials.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to monitor profitability.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, `EventSubscriber`, etc.

❗ Not all exchanges support sandbox/testnet environments.

## 3. Live Exchange (Real Money Trading)

Use the Trader plugin with your production API credentials for live trading.
It connects directly to your exchange account, places actual orders based on your strategy's advice, and manages your real portfolio.

✅ Good for:
- Live deployment of a thoroughly tested strategy.

⚙️ Required Plugins:
- `TradingAdvisor` – to run the strategy.
- `Trader` – with real API credentials.
- `PerformanceAnalyzer` – to monitor performance.
- *(optional)* `CandleWriter`, `EventSubscriber`, etc.

❗ High risk: Make sure your strategy has been tested thoroughly.  
Gekko only executes what your strategy tells it to do.

## General Notes

- Configure the Trader plugin once and pair it with exactly one exchange connection (dummy, sandbox, or live).
- Realtime mode supports **plugin composition**, so you can add loggers, notifications, performance analysis, etc.
- It's ideal to run Gekko in a long-lived environment like a VPS or Docker container.

## Recommended Before Going Live

- Backtest thoroughly using historical data.
- Run with the dummy exchange or a sandbox environment for an extended period.
- Monitor logs and Telegram messages for unexpected behavior.
- Ensure you understand the exchange’s fees, limits, and slippage risks.

## Warmup

When `watch.warmup.candleCount` is greater than zero, Gekko will fetch historical candles before starting realtime trading. This allows your strategy and plugins to initialize with sufficient data.

## Example Realtime Configuration

```yaml
watch:
  asset: BTC
  currency: USDT
  mode: realtime
  timeframe: '1m' # default timeframe is 1m
  warmup:
    candleCount: 10

exchange:
  name: dummy-cex # swap to 'binance' for sandbox/live trading

strategy:
  name: MyAwesomeStrategy
  # strategy-specific params...

plugins:
  - name: TradingAdvisor
    strategyName: MyAwesomeStrategy

  - name: Trader

  - name: PerformanceAnalyzer

  - name: Telegram
    token: YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
