# Strategies

In Gekko, a **strategy** is a trading algorithm that analyzes price data and makes decisions about when to buy or sell. Strategies rely on technical indicators and are designed to emit **advice**: either to go `long` (buy) or `short` (sell).

Strategies are the core of Gekkoâ€™s decision-making process, and they run on every candle received from the market.

## What does a strategy do?

At its core, a strategy:

- Receives new market candles in real time or during backtesting.
- Runs indicators to interpret the market.
- Makes decisions based on predefined logic.
- Emits advice (`long`, `short`, or trigger-based entries).
- Reacts to trades once theyâ€™re executed (via broker or simulation).
- Optionally logs or notifies events for debugging or visualization.

```
ðŸ’¡ Note:
Strategies **do not execute trades directly**.
Instead, they emit advice events that are consumed by other plugins (like Trader or PaperTrader).
```
