# Supporting the project

Gekko is free and open source software. We don't make any money by publishing it, keeping it up to date or providing support.

If Gekko helped you in any way (financially or otherwise) feel free to donate. If you want to see a specific feature implemented, feel free to open a new issue on [github](https://github.com/youtix/gekko2/issues) to discuss.

Ways to support the project will be made available in upcoming releases.
