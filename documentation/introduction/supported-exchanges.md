## Supported Exchanges

Gekko can communicate directly with the APIs of several cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the level of integration varies by exchange. Gekko distinguishes between the following features:

- **Monitoring**: Gekko can retrieve live market data from the exchange. This data can be stored or used to run trading strategies in real-time.
- **Live Trading**: Gekko can automatically execute buy and sell orders based on your strategyâ€™s signals, turning it into a fully automated trading bot.
- **Importing**: Gekko can download historical market data from the exchange, allowing you to backtest strategies on real past market conditions.
