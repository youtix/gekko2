# Supported Exchanges

Gekko can interact directly with the APIs of multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the level of integration varies between exchanges. Depending on the exchange, Gekko supports the following features:

- **Monitoring**: Gekko can retrieve live market data from the exchange. This data can be stored or used to run trading strategies in real-time.
- **Sandbox**: Gekko can simulate live trading using the exchange's sandbox/testnet APIs, executing buy and sell orders based on your strategy.
- **Live Trading**: Gekko can execute real orders using live funds, transforming it into a fully automated trading bot.
- **Importing**: Gekko can download historical market data from the exchange, allowing you to backtest strategies on real past market conditions.
