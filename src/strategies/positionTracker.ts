 * while an order of its own is pending, and this is the bookkeeping that tells it which.
 *
 * - It starts flat: a holding present at start-up is sold only by its first SELL, which follows a BUY that completed, or one that
 *   ended without completing while the account held it (see settleUnfinished).
 * - A completed BUY makes it long, a completed SELL flat.
 * - A canceled or errored order may have executed all the same, in part or in full: the position is read from what its event
 *   reports, long when what the order leaves held is enough to sell (see settleUnfinished). Nothing reported, it stays as it was.
 * - The outcome of an order that is not its own changes nothing, and an order counts once: its first outcome settles it.
 *
 * The strategy places its orders through buy and sell once canBuy or canSell allows it, and hands the params of its three order
 * hooks over as it gets them, whole: the event, with the portfolio after the order, and the tools, with the market data and the log.
