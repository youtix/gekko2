/**
 * GridBot Strategy
 *
 * Places a grid of LIMIT orders around the current price.
 * - The grid is placed on the first timeframe candle after the warmup, centred on its close
 * - Buy levels are placed below the center price
 * - Sell levels are placed above the center price
 * - Spacing between levels is configurable: fixed, percent, or logarithmic. A spacing that rounds two adjacent prices of the grid to
 *   the same tick stops the run, and one under the round-trip fee, two maker fees, is warned of once
 * - Prices are rounded to the tick of the market (precision.price) as they are written, in decimal, a tie upwards. A market that states
 *   no tick has them rounded to 8 decimals, with a warning
 * - Each level trades back and forth between two adjacent prices of the grid: once its BUY fills it sells one step above, once its
 *   SELL fills it buys one step below
 * - Mandatory rebalancing ensures 50/50 portfolio allocation before grid building
 * - The rebalance and the grid use the free balances, and every order is one the market takes, of at least its minimum amount and
 *   cost: a rebalance under them is not sent, and a side that cannot fund all its levels with them leaves out the farthest
 * - A refused or canceled order is placed again up to retryOnError times, a canceled grid order for what is left of it. A grid order
 *   is then left out with a warning, the rest of the grid trading on until no level holds an order, and a rebalance stops the run
 * - An order whose outcome is unknown, which may be live on the exchange, is never placed again: a grid order is left out with a
 *   warning, the run stopping once more than retryOnError orders are in that case or no level holds an order, and a rebalance
 *   stops the run
 * - When price exits the grid range, a warning is logged but trading continues
