   *
   * The order holds no key but those of StrategyOrder: `symbol`, `side`, `type`, `amount`, `price` and `trailing`. Any other, whatever
   * its value, throws a GekkoError naming it, and the order is not sent: the bot stops. The Trader reads those keys alone and ignored
   * any other: a LIMIT whose price was misspelt (`limitPrice`, `prise`) went at the last price of the pair, an amount given as
   * `quantity` made the order all-in, a stop given under another name was dropped. The order of an event, passed as it is, holds keys
   * of its own, such as `id` and `orderCreationDate`: build the order from its fields.
   *
   * `symbol` must be a watched pair, a key of `marketData`: Gekko has no candle, price or balance of any other pair, so it could
   * neither follow the position nor trail its stop, while a live exchange would still execute the order. Any other symbol throws a
   * GekkoError naming it and the watched pairs, and the order is not sent: the bot stops.
   *
   * `side` must be 'BUY' or 'SELL', and `type` 'MARKET', 'STICKY' or 'LIMIT', in upper case: ccxt spells them in lower case, which
   * only an untyped strategy can pass. `amount` and `price` must be numbers above 0, or left out. An amount left out makes the order
   * all-in, sized by the Trader from the portfolio of its last synchronization: a BUY spends the currency free less the 5 % the Trader
   * keeps back for the fee (DEFAULT_FEE_BUFFER), at the price of the order; a SELL sells the asset free, less what the SELLs placed
   * since then take. A price left out is the last price of the pair: the limit of a LIMIT order, and what an all-in BUY is sized at.
   * Anything else (NaN, 0, a negative number, Infinity, a quoted number) throws a GekkoError naming the field and what it accepts, and
   * the order is not sent: the bot stops, even for an amount a strategy computed as 0, which used to come back as an order error.
   *
   * A `trailing` is checked before anything is relayed: on a BUY only, with a percentage above 0 and below 100, a trigger above 0 or
   * left out, and no other key (a trigger misspelt `triger` armed a stop active at once). Anything else throws a GekkoError and the
   * order is not sent: the bot stops. The stop is armed, once the BUY completes, from a copy taken here: changing the object
   * afterwards moves nothing.
   *
   * A stop protects the position its BUY opened until the strategy sells on that pair: once a SELL the strategy created completes
   * there, every stop armed on the pair is canceled, whatever the amount sold, with a line at info level. So a strategy that scales
   * out loses its stops at its first SELL. The SELL a stop sends cancels no other stop, and a stop whose BUY has not completed yet is
   * kept: it protects the position that BUY opens.
   *
   * While a SELL the strategy created is pending on a pair, the stops of that pair trail on but do not trigger (said once per stop,
   * at info level): the exchange reserves the asset for that SELL, and the SELL of a stop would be refused. Canceled or errored, with
   * no other SELL of the strategy pending there, that SELL releases them (at info level too): from the next minute, a price at or
   * below a stop price triggers that stop. So a SELL left pending, a take-profit LIMIT above the market for instance, leaves the
   * position without a working stop for as long as it pends, the part of the position it does not reserve included.
   *
   * A BUY that errors after filling part of its amount (`order.filled` in onOrderErrored) gets its stop for that part, with a
   * warning. One that errors with no fill reported loses it, with a warning too. When the BUY may still be live on the exchange
   * (`order.mayBeLive`), the warning adds that what it may still fill, or may have executed unreported, has no stop. A BUY canceled
   * loses its stop, even after a partial fill.
