 * The moving averages an indicator can smooth with, by the name its maType parameter takes. A new kind is added here only: the names
 * the maType checks accept, MovingAverageTypes and MovingAverageClasses derive from this map. BollingerBands, EFI and Stochastic used
 * to hold a copy each, where a wrong class compiled unnoticed.
 * No moving average may import this file, even indirectly. In indicator.const.ts, which they import through indicator.utils.ts, the map
 * would close a cycle: a moving average loaded first would throw "Cannot access 'SMA' before initialization" under Bun, and be missing
 * from the map under vitest.
