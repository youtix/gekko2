/**
 * A moving average of one number per candle, the price its src names. It takes each number through update, which onNewCandle calls
 * with the candle's price, so that an indicator built on one feeds it its own values as they are: a force, a true range, the line of
 * another average. Those used to go in as the close of a made-up candle cast to Candle, an object per value and a cast that hid from
 * tsc which fields the average read: one built with another src read a field that candle lacked, and was NaN.
 * A new moving average extends this class: it checks its parameters, passes src to super and implements update.
