 *
 * Several runs can find the same stale lock. Were each to remove it, one could remove it and lock again before another removed
 * that new lock, taking it for the stale one: both runs would then hold the lock. Renaming the stale lock away before deleting
 * it does not help, as the rename can move the new lock just as well. So a stale lock is only removed by the holder of a
 * second lock, the guard, after checking its age again: from then on only the run that left it, which is gone, or the holder
 * of the guard could remove it, so no new lock can take its place before it is removed. The guard is held for microseconds,
 * so one older than `staleMs` was left by a run killed while holding it, and is simply removed (two runs doing so at the same
 * instant could both take the guard, but that takes such a kill first). ENOENT at any step means that another run got there
 * first, or that the lock was released: the attempt failed, and the next one will tell.
