 * - A rate given by ccxt is a fraction (0.001 for 0.1 %): it is multiplied by 100. ccxt 4.5.39 gives none for binance or hyperliquid.
 * - Otherwise the rate is derived from the cost and the currency of the fee, which both drivers give. A fee paid in the quote

 *   ccxt maps the tokens to: the token is also matched with the baseName of the market (UBTC for BTC/USDC) and its quoteId (USDT0 for

 * - A fee paid in any other currency, such as BNB with Binance's fee discount, is not converted: its rate is unknown.

 * amount and price are written (multiplyPrecise), the one division rounded to 15 significant digits (toSignificantDigits). In binary,
