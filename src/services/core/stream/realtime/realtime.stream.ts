/**
 * Pushes the closed 1-minute candles of one pair, in order, from `startMinute` on (the minutes before it belong to the warmup
 * history). Its heart ticks a grace period after each minute boundary; each tick asks the exchange for every closed minute not
 * pushed yet, so that a minute whose fetch failed or came back empty is asked again on the next tick. It fails with a GekkoError
 * once REALTIME_MAX_TICKS_WITHOUT_CANDLE consecutive ticks have pushed nothing.
 *
 * `startMinute` comes from the pipeline, which reads the clock once for every pair and ends the warmup history the minute before.
 * Read by each stream as it is built, a start-up that crosses a minute boundary would start the pairs on different minutes and make
 * the live minutes overlap the history or leave a gap after it.
