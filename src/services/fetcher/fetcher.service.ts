 * - a 2xx whose body cannot be read or parsed answers a request that went through: a GET is sent again after the backoff
 *   (getUpdates, at the same offset, loses nothing), a POST is thrown at once, since its message may have been delivered.
 * Any other failure would be met again, so it is thrown at once: a 4xx such as 400 (bad request), 401 (wrong token), 403 (bot
 * blocked by the user) or 409 (another getUpdates consumer of the token), whatever its body (a proxy's HTML page, an empty one).
